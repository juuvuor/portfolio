## About

This portfolio website is a collection of my work and achievements. It includes various projects that I have worked on, demonstrating my skills in web development, programming, and more.

## Projects

### Ref-Helper
- **Description**: The Ref-Helper school group project is a comprehensive tool designed to manage bibliographic references efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding, listing, editing, and deleting references, typically stored in BibTeX format. This project is particularly useful for researchers, students, and academics who need to organize and maintain their bibliographies for academic papers, theses, or research projects.
- **Technologies**: Python, RobotFramework, GitHub, Codecov

### Full Stack Open course tasks
